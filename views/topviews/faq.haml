              %p
                The Wikimedia pageviews API was introduced in August 2015 and does not include data from before that time. You will have to rely on other tools such as <a href="http://stats.grok.se">stats.grok.se</a> to view data older than this. Whether or not they work is unfortunately outside the scope of the Topviews Anaylsis tool, and beyond the control of the maintainers.

                %strong Why can't I view data for today's date?
              %p
                The Wikimedia pageviews API generally takes a full 24 hours to populate, sometimes longer. In some situations you may see data missing for yesterday's date as well, which will be left blank rather than showing a count of zero views.

                %strong Why do I need to disable my ad blocker?
              %p
                There are no ads being served. It's actually the <a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/?doc#/">Wikimedia REST API</a> that the ad blockers are complaining about. This is due to the fact that the URL for the API request includes the string "/pageviews/", which is blacklisted by the <a href="https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easyprivacy.txt">EasyPrivacy list</a>. If your ad blocker allows you to control which lists you are subscribed to, removing the subscription to EasyPrivacy should also solve the issue.

If you have a new request, creating a new issue there is preferred, but you may also contact the developer directly on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MusikAnimal">Wikipedia</a>.
